/*
Implementing a Value Remover Function
In this lab, I create a function that takes an initial array as its first argument, followed by one or more additional arguments representing the values to remove.

User Stories:

1. I create a `destroyer` function that accepts an array and one or more additional arguments.
2. The `destroyer` function returns a new array excluding all elements from the first argument that match any of the subsequent arguments.
3. The function accepts an indeterminate number of arguments.
